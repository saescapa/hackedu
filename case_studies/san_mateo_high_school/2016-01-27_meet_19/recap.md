# 19th Meeting

## What Happened

- We went through the slides, we had 2 new members come join in.
- We briefed them and gave them links to previous workshops.
- Went around helping.

## Problems we faced

- Not much really, again not too much activity, just going around helping.

## Tips

- Always nice to receive new people, make sure you are as helpful as possible
  as you want them to stay with the club and understand what is the way the club
  works.
