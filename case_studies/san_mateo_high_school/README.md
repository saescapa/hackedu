# San Mateo Programming Club

Welcome to San Mateo's Programming Club case studies! We have a
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SMHS-Programming/club/tree/70c64404331b85369d098da277f473424a14273b)
where we keep all of our progress and works. Similar to
[Hack Club's](https://github/hackclub/hackclub)
[Hack Camp](https://github.com/hackclub/hack-camp).

## Meetings

We meet on Mondays and Wednesdays during lunch time, roughly 25 minutes to work
on workshops, project time and demos. We work on 5 week cycles:

- Week 1 & 2 are dedicated to Workshops and Learning.
- Week 3 & 4 are for hackers to work on projects with their partners
- Week 5 is Demo Week, everyone ships their projects and demos them to the
  rest of the hackers.

## Plans for the future

We plan to attend a lot of hackathons, for example HackingEDU, and we hope to
be able to have field trips with the Girls Who Code club and organize hackathons
with them.

## Activities log

Not all of our meets will be in this table, but all our important activities
will all be here. The purpose of this is to give a quick link to leaders who
are looking for specific things.
